## Earthquake risk
US Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program, 2014 Long-term Model

This data describes the annual frequency of exceeding a set of ground motions, and represents an assessment of the best available science in earthquake hazards and incorporate new findings on earthquake ground shaking, faults, seismicity, and geodesy.  The USGS uses many definitons of earthquake risk.  The data that we chose to use in our app corresponds to the 50-year probability that an earthquake will result in a certain peak ground acceleration (units are fraction of standard gravity).
